## Who it’s for
Men age **18–85** who want to lead with conviction — in their home, their work, and their community.

## What changes
- You step into the light without shame.
- You learn to lead yourself before you try to lead others.
- You rebuild integrity (the inside matching the outside).
- You stop repeating the same patterns and start writing a new story.
